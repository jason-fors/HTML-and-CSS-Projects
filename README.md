### Antiques-by-Carmody
This is a simple web page for an antiques shop. It includes a gallery and form. 

### Boostrap4_Project
This project is a web page for a movie theater created in part using Bootstrap. It includes columns, cards, images and other elements.

### One-Page-Website
You guessed it. This is a one-page website. The content is a fictitious algebra study guide. Images, navbar, embedded video and form included.

### Portfolio-Website
A first draft of a website for me as a developer which has some animations. 

### Practice and Learning Pages
This area contains numerous small practice pages, templates and applications of isolated common HTML elements.

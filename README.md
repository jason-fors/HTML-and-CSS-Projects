# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

These are some pages I made while first learning HTML and CSS.

### Projects

* Antiques-by-Carmody: A simple web page for an antiques shop.
* Bootstrap4-Project: A web page for a movie theater created in part using Bootstrap.
* Several other small practice pages and CSS documents for creating common web page elements.
